1.6) 
I used this SELinux policy to allow vulnweb.php to access my /root/access.txt
/root/noaccess.txt files since they are of type admin_home_t.

module my-httpd 1.0;

require {
	type admin_home_t;
	type httpd_t;
	class file { getattr open read };
}

allow httpd_t admin_home_t:file { getattr open read };

1.7)
To deny access to /root/noaccess.txt, I ran
[jienchen@localhost root]sudo chmod 700 ./noaccess.txt
To check the permissions, I ran 
[jienchen@localhost root]ls -Z noaccess.txt
-rwx------. root root unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 noaccess.txt
Now only the user had full access while the user's group and other users had 
no permissions at all.

2.1) 
I created another Linux user gn and used
[jienchen@localhost root]semanage login -a -s guest_u gn
to change it to a guest_u from an unconfined_u

2.2) 
I created a SELinux policy .te file that denied guest_t types access from other guest_t types.

module nopass 1.0;

require{
    type guest_t;
    class file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open execute};
}

neverallow guest_t guest_t:file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open execute};

2.3) 
I then SSH'ed into my other Linux user (gn) and ran the exploit. 

[gn@localhost hw1]$ ./hw1new 
Welcome to CSE331!
Enter some text:
You entered:
Bye!

It automatically exited without running the attack file and normal functionality of hw1new was perserved.
